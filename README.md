# GPS-based scheduler for International WSPR Beacon Project

## Introduction

[Globally deployed WSPR Beacons](https://github.com/HB9VQQ/WSPRBeacon) - Synchronized weak signal Network - same Power - same Band hopping schedule - 80,40,20,15,10m 24x7x365. Coordinated WSPR Band hopping transmit schedule following the [WSJT-X implementation](https://www.physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/wsjtx-doc/wsjtx-main-2.3.0.html#_band_hopping)

For each enabled Band the scheduler will start to transmit at the corresponding Minute.

## What is the problem?

The WSPR beacon uses a transmitting antenna, which cannot be simultaneously tuned on all bands from 80 to 10 meters. SWR on different bands will not be optimal. Therefore, the question arises - how to improve this system, taking into account the fact that we are tied to the schedule.

## What should we do?

Since we have a schedule, we can switch antennas (or matching a multiband tuner near our antenna) between bands according to the schedule. We can also use GPS signals for synchronization. Thus the scheme of this device was created.

It is based on MCU STM32G030K8 and GPS receiver module ATGM332D.
